## STOCK Q & A
Stock Q&A with OpenAI and Pinecone
This project implements a Stock Q&A system that leverages OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) and Pinecone vector database to answer user questions about stocks based on a provided document.

Data Preparation:

Document Processing: Preprocess the stock document to extract relevant information about companies, financials, and market trends. 

Information extraction to structure data into a format suitable for Pinecone (e.g., company name, key financial ratios, market performance)

Document Embedding: Generate vector embeddings for the processed document using OpenAI's API or other embedding techniques. Embeddings represent the document's semantic meaning in a high-dimensional vector space.

Pinecone Indexing: Store the document embeddings and any additional metadata (e.g., document title) in Pinecone. Pinecone is a vector database optimized for efficient similarity search.
Q&A System:

User Input: The user submits a question related to stocks or the provided document.

Question Embedding: Generate a vector embedding for the user's question using OpenAI's API or other embedding techniques.

Similarity Search in Pinecone: Use Pinecone to find documents (embeddings) in the database that are most similar to the user's question embedding. This retrieves the most relevant sections of the document that might answer the question.

Answer Generation: Based on the retrieved document sections identified in step 3, use OpenAI's LLMs to formulate a comprehensive and informative answer to the user's question. The answer should summarize the relevant information from the document and potentially use additional reasoning or insights from the LLM.
